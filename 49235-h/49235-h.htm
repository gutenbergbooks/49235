<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>A thumbnail sketch like the present is, of course, the
last place in the world to recount even an infinitesimal
part of a life so vivid and crowded with bitter conflict
and tragic experience as that of Hector Berlioz; and the
person who attempts it is beaten in advance. Moreover,
such an effort seems almost gratuitous. For Berlioz has
told his own story better than anyone else could possibly
do it. When Ernest Newman was asked at one time
to write a new biography of the epoch-making composer
he informed the publisher who suggested it that &ldquo;no
Life by any other hands will ever be able to bear comparison
as a piece of literature with Berlioz&rsquo; Autobiography.
All others are for the most part a watering
down into the author&rsquo;s inferior style of the sparkling
prose of Berlioz himself&rdquo;. How much more futile is it to
attempt on the minuscule scale of the following tiny, if
rambling, pamphlet to touch upon even a thousandth
of those achievements and unremitting conflicts which
entered into the texture of this master&rsquo;s agitated and
inharmonious life! Actually, it aims to do no more than
contribute a mite toward a larger interest in the writings
and the great mass of insufficiently discovered compositions
of a Romanticist whose labors are still surprisingly
unrecognized art works of the future.</p>

<h1 title="">HECTOR BERLIOZ
<br /><i>A Romantic Tragedy</i></h1>
<p class="center"><i>By</i>
<br />HERBERT F. PEYSER</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;No doubt I deserve to go to Hell&rdquo;, said Berlioz once
to a friend who had reproached him for his treatment of
Henrietta Smithson, his first wife; &ldquo;but what would you
have? I am in Hell already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not an exaggeration or a figure of speech.
Berlioz was in hell the greater part of his life. Of all
the great composers he was perhaps the most consistently
wretched. Misery and frustration pursued him from his
youth to his grave. Time and again his existence seemed
like the fulfillment of a curse. Actually, his mother had
called one down upon him at the very beginning of his
career and for the rest of his days it appeared to work
itself out implacably. One might even believe the malediction
had retained its power beyond the tomb. For the
posthumous glory of Berlioz is by no means unchallenged.
Almost alone among the masters he does not command
anything like universal admiration, let alone affection.
He has his redoubtable champions and they include
many of the greatest musicians, living and dead. But
where Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Schubert,
Brahms, Wagner need no defense Berlioz incontestably
does. Rightly or wrongly he continues to be a problem,
with all that this condition implies. Yet without him
music could not conceivably be just what it is. And perhaps
the strangest aspect of the paradox is that only a
limited portion of his output enjoys anything like what
might be called frequent hearing. The greater part of
his greatest works remains to all intents, undiscovered&mdash;nay,
unsuspected&mdash;by the multitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>The little mountain town, La C&ocirc;te-Saint-Andr&eacute;, where
Louis-Hector Berlioz was born on December 11, 1803,
had briefly been called La C&ocirc;te-Bonne-Eau during the
Revolution and the Reign of Terror when &ldquo;saints&rdquo;, for
a while, went out of fashion. It was not far from Grenoble
on one side or from Lyon on another. The Berlioz family
originated in Savoie and can be traced back to the sixteenth
century. Hector&rsquo;s father, Louis Berlioz, a doctor
and a property owner, had at one time been mayor of
La C&ocirc;te-Saint-Andr&eacute;. In 1802 he had married Marie-Antoinette-Jos&eacute;phine
Marmion, a good-looking woman,
religious to the point of bigotry. Hector was the oldest
of six children, two of whom died at an early age. The
surviving daughters, Nanci and Ad&egrave;le, were followed as
late as 1820 by a son, Prosper, a &ldquo;problem child&rdquo; in the
truest sense of the term, vague and unmanageable up to
the time of a belated adolescence, then developing into
a mathematical genius and dying in his twentieth year
before people had ceased to marvel at his talents.</p>
<p>Hector&rsquo;s father supervised his early education, though
it was probably as a concession to his wife that he placed
the youngster in the local Catholic Seminary. The boy
did not stay there long even if his mother harbored ambitions
of making a saint of him. For a time he went
uncomplainingly to mass, communion, confession and
the rest. In his Memoirs Hector tells us details of his
weekly &ldquo;confessions&rdquo; when he would say to the &ldquo;director&rdquo;
of his conscience &ldquo;My father, I have done nothing&rdquo;
and that worthy would reply &ldquo;Go on, my child, as you
have begun&rdquo;. And so he did&mdash;for several years, at least.</p>
<p>Yet his mother&rsquo;s religiosity was to have the effect of
turning Hector&rsquo;s thoughts away from the church and
toward the great figures of classical mythology. He &ldquo;felt
his heart throb and his voice quiver and break&rdquo; when he
construed the fourth book of Virgil&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aeneid&rdquo; to his
father; and when the good man tactfully cut the lesson
short Hector was &ldquo;intensely grateful to him for taking no
notice of my emotion and rushed away to vent my Virgilian
grief in solitude&rdquo;. Mythology was not the only
love with which his father filled him; under the paternal
guidance he developed an interest in geography and
stories of travel helped fire his imagination.</p>

<p>From an early age Hector had shown a sensitiveness
to musical impressions and, besides learning to sing at
sight, acquired some proficiency in playing the flute and
the flageolet&mdash;though &ldquo;I was twelve before the magic of
music was revealed to me&rdquo;. Presently he added to his
musical accomplishments the playing of the guitar. The
piano he never, apparently, undertook to master. But
in later years he made a virtue of necessity and insisted
he was glad to compose &ldquo;silently and freely&rdquo; without
having to depend on the keyboard. With harmony it was
rather different and after an unsuccessful start with
Rameau&rsquo;s treatise on the subject, even in a simplified
form, he had recourse to a text book by Catel in order
to pick up some elementary principles. These he presently
put to use in a &ldquo;six part potpourri on a collection of
Italian airs&rdquo; and in the composition of a couple of quintets
for flute and strings. The first was played by some
local amateurs and aroused the enthusiasm of all the
hearers except Hector&rsquo;s father. Dr. Berlioz preferred as
much of the later quintet as his son was able to play
him on the flute, but the piece being much more difficult,
the amateur executants who tried it quickly suffered
shipwreck. The composer eventually burned both scores
yet salvaged a theme his father had liked and then used
it in his overture, &ldquo;Les Francs-Juges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simultaneously with these hit or miss musical studies
the boy&rsquo;s emotional life was heightened at about this
time by an incipient love affair, if one can call it so.
Hector&rsquo;s relatives, the Marmions, had a country house
near Grenoble in the village of Meylan, where he spent
his vacations. Not far away, in a white cottage, surrounded
by vineyards and gardens there lived with her
mother and sister a tall and exceedingly pretty girl of
eighteen, Estelle Duboeuf. At a family garden party, to

which Hector and his relations had been invited, Estelle
picked him for her partner in some game. Poor Hector
was conquered in the twinkling of an eye. When a few
minutes later he caught sight of Estelle dancing with his
uncle Marmion&mdash;who had been a soldier in Napoleon&rsquo;s
armies and cut a superb figure in his gaudy uniform and
clanking spurs&mdash;the boy flew into a jealous rage, only to
have the whole party laugh at him! But Estelle&mdash;his
&ldquo;Stella montis&rdquo;, his &ldquo;Star of the Mountain&rdquo;&mdash;remained
enshrined in his memory for life. Their ways were to
separate and they lost track of each other for years. A
haggard old man, wracked and buffeted by numberless
woes and disappointments, he found her again and sought
solace (vainly, as it proved) in an attempt to recapture
the shadow of a childhood fancy. His reward was a polite
note signed Estelle Fornier&mdash;her married name&mdash;and a
conventional &ldquo;affectionate greetings&rdquo;, into which he
chose to read meanings that the old lady never remotely
intended!</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Hector&rsquo;s parents determined he should follow in his
father&rsquo;s footsteps and become a physician. The idea revolted
him and he struggled against it much as Schumann
combated his mother&rsquo;s wish to make a jurist of a youth
with the soul of a poet. Nevertheless, he made as if to
comply with the parental will&mdash;though one can guess
with how many unspoken reservations! And so in the
autumn of 1821, he set off for Paris to study medicine.
But what fascinated him there were the theatres, the
opera houses, the concert halls&mdash;things which up to that
time he had never enjoyed the opportunity of visiting&mdash;and
not the loathsome hospitals, anatomical amphitheatres,
dissecting rooms and other nauseating horrors.
He had felt all along that he was never intended to spend
his life &ldquo;at the bedside of sick people, in hospitals and
dissecting chambers&rdquo;. His father had made the cardinal
mistake of &ldquo;using his love of music as a lever for removing
his &lsquo;childish aversion&rsquo; to embark on the study of
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
medicine&rdquo; and, as a reward for working earnestly at
osteology had given his refractory son nothing less to the
purpose than &ldquo;a splendid flute, with all the new keys&rdquo;!</p>
<p>In Paris Hector lost no time visiting the Op&eacute;ra, the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Italien, the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Feydeau, the Ambigu-Comique.
He heard Salieri&rsquo;s &ldquo;Danaides&rdquo;, Boieldieu&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Voitures Vers&eacute;es&rdquo;, Dalayrac&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nina&rdquo;. Above all, he
heard Gluck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Iphig&eacute;nie en Tauride&rdquo;, and this masterpiece
definitely settled the question. His life would be
dedicated to music and medicine could go hang! Berlioz
the scarlet Romanticist was born at the moment he
solemnly made this resolve. It was farewell, henceforth,
to the &ldquo;human charnel house, littered with fragments of
limbs, ghastly faces and cloven heads ... where swarms
of sparrows fought for scraps and rats in the corners
gnawed human vertebrae.&rdquo; He had, to be sure, grown
somewhat hardened after his first appalling impression
and had even gotten so far as to &ldquo;cast a shoulder blade to
a great rat which was staring at me with famished eyes&rdquo;!
But the physical reactions he experienced to the music he
loved attracted him in the same degree as the horrid
displays of the hospital laboratories revolted him. In the
theatre listening to Gluck and Spontini &ldquo;his knees would
tremble convulsively, his teeth chatter, he suffered with
dizzy spells till he could not stand unsupported, he was
bathed in sweat, his scalp contracted, tears choked him,
he lost all sensation in fingers and toes, he was seized
with chills and hot flashes....&rdquo; If this was not actually
a type of celestial intoxication it was certainly a romantic
imagination conveyed through the empurpled diction of
the hour!</p>
<p>Down at his home in the Dauphin&eacute; Dr. Berlioz gradually
got wind of what was happening and endeavored to
reason with his son. The latter was frequenting the library
of the Conservatoire, voraciously devouring the scores of
Gluck, and leaving to those who had a taste for that sort
of thing the sanguinary details of the anatomical chamber.
And not only did he study the music of Gluck, M&eacute;hul
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
and others but he addressed himself to the first two
symphonies of Beethoven, at that time as good as unknown
in Paris. In the Conservatoire library he met a
certain Hyacinthe Christophe Gerono, a pupil of Lesueur,
who counseled Hector to study with his affable old
master, at one time a great favorite. Lesueur received
Hector amiably at the first visit, examined a few compositions
of the young man, pronounced them faulty but
urged him to undertake some preparatory studies under
Gerono, a task he willingly accepted.</p>
<p>In a short time Gerono indoctrinated him so thoroughly
in Lesueur&rsquo;s harmonic system that the latter cordially
took him as a pupil. Not that Hector accepted his
mentor&rsquo;s teaching without many unspoken questions, but
he quickly decided that the most diplomatic thing to do
was to curb whatever impatience he felt and listen in
silence. He had already written a choral work, &ldquo;Le
Passage de la Mer Rouge&rdquo; and a Mass, and though they
were youthful attempts and obviously unripe he found
it possible to dispense with conventional rules. And now
he felt moved to attempt an opera! The obliging Gerono
supplied him with a libretto and the fruit of this collaboration
was called &ldquo;Estelle et N&eacute;morin,&rdquo; Estelle Duboeuf
doubtless floating before his mind&rsquo;s eye. Berlioz
admits that the music was &ldquo;feeble&rdquo; and called the entire
work &ldquo;wishy-washy&rdquo;. As for the Mass, composed by request
for the feast day of the choir children of the Church
of Saint Roch, portions of it met the approval of Lesueur.
When it came to paying the costs of its performance
Hector was in a quandary about raising the necessary
1,200 francs. Finally he borrowed the sum from a friend,
Augustin de Pons&mdash;a step he was presently to regret
though Pons had lent him the money with the best of
intentions. The Mass itself was praised and some years
later was repeated at the Church of St. Eustache. By this
time, however, the composer had become dissatisfied
with the work and then burned it together with several
juvenile effusions. Meanwhile he had a stormy first meeting
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
with Cherubini, head of the Conservatoire; and he
failed to pass a preliminary examination for that august
school.</p>
<p>Hearing of this misfortune, Dr. Berlioz, usually slow
to wrath, lost his temper and resolved to stop his son&rsquo;s
allowance. If anything Lesueur aggravated the situation
by attempting to intercede on his pupil&rsquo;s behalf. Hector
was summoned home and ordered to renounce his ideas
of a musical career and take up some other occupation.
In spite of the chilling reception the young black sheep
encountered there he was astonished and delighted to
learn a few days later that the good doctor had once more
reconsidered. &ldquo;After several sleepless nights I have made
up my mind&rdquo;, he gravely told his son. &ldquo;You shall go to
Paris and study music; but only for a time. If after
further trials you fail you will, I am sure, acknowledge
that I have done what was right, and you will choose
some other career. You know what I think of second-rate
poets; second-rate artists are no better and it would
be a deep sorrow and profound humiliation to me to see
you numbered among these useless members of society&rdquo;.
And he swore the youth to secrecy. But the news leaked
out and before Hector could take his place in the stage-coach
his mother, blazing with anger, confronted him
&ldquo;with flashing eyes and exciting gestures&rdquo;: &ldquo;Your
father&rdquo;, she exclaimed, &ldquo;has been weak enough to allow
you to return to Paris and to encourage your mad, wicked
plans; but I will not have this guilt on my soul and,
once and for all, I forbid your departure ... I beseech
you not to persist in your folly! See, I, your mother kneel
to you and beg you humbly to renounce it&rdquo;. And when
the appalled Hector begged her to rise she defied him,
wildly: &ldquo;No; I will kneel! So, wretched boy, you refuse?
You can stand unmoved with your mother kneeling at
your feet? Well, then, go! Go and wallow in the filth of
Paris, sully your name and kill your father and me with
sorrow and shame! I will not re-enter this house till you
have left it. You are my son no longer! I curse you!&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
Hector had to leave, as he says, &ldquo;without bidding her
good-bye, without another word or a look, and with her
curse on my head!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Back in Paris his first object was to repay Pons part of
the money he owed him for the performance of the Saint
Roch mass. He earned a few francs by giving occasional
lessons in singing and by teaching flute and guitar. His
monthly allowance amounted only to 120 francs, so the
repayment was a slow and painful business. Most unhappily
Pons, wishing to spare Hector this continuous
drain on his purse, resolved to &ldquo;help&rdquo; his friend by
writing Dr. Berlioz and asking him to settle the remainder
of the debt. Pons got his money&mdash;but poor
Hector lost his allowance!</p>
<p>Somehow he managed to scrape along. He had a tiny
room, five flights up, in the Cit&eacute;, at the corner of the
Quai des Orf&egrave;vres and the Rue de Harley; he gave up
dining in restaurants and confined his diet to dry bread
and salt, with now and then raisins or dates. When the
weather was favorable he took this meal on the Pont
Neuf, beside the statue of Henri IV, watching the
passersby or gazing at the muddy waters of the Seine.
He worked tirelessly at his music. Cherubini, now apparently
mollified, put the youth into Reicha&rsquo;s class for
counterpoint and fugue at the Conservatoire, even while
he continued with Lesueur. Hector struck up a life-long
friendship with young Humbert Ferrand, who wrote him
an opera book, &ldquo;Les Franc-Juges&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Judges of the
Secret Court&rdquo;&mdash;which he enthusiastically set to music
but of which only the overture remains. It is a fine thing
of its type, bearing melodically, instrumentally and harmonically,
the unmistakable imprint of Berlioz even to
the reminders of Gluck. One of its most striking themes
survives from the boyish quintet of Hector&rsquo;s and anticipates
in a fashion the &ldquo;id&eacute;e fixe&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Symphonie
Fantastique&rdquo;, not very far ahead.</p>
<p>Working on his opera young Berlioz had somewhat
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
neglected his flute and guitar pupils and once more
needed money. Even a franc a lesson would not help
greatly when it became a question of winter clothes and
firewood. Far from capitulating and returning, beaten,
to Dauphin&eacute;, he first toyed with the idea of seeking a
position as first or second flute in some orchestra &ldquo;in
New York, Mexico, Sydney or Calcutta, of becoming a
sailor, filibuster, buccaneer or savage in China&rdquo; or attempting
any other wild scheme since &ldquo;it is futile and
dangerous to thwart my will when I am resolved on
anything&rdquo;. In the end he tried a safer, less exciting
method. Aided by a streak of luck and an exceptionally
good musical memory, he obtained an engagement as a
chorus singer at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Nouveaut&eacute;s, where
basses were wanted but where a passable baritone could
also be of use. By singing as a trial piece a recitative
from Sacchini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oedipe&rdquo; he prevailed over a weaver, a
blacksmith, an actor and a choir member from St.
Eustache. The job paid him fifty francs a month. Hector
had not only to sing all manner of rubbish but &ldquo;the
colossal manager&rdquo;, a Mr. St. L&eacute;ger, sometimes obliged
him to be &ldquo;the rear leg of an artificial camel&rdquo;! Even so,
it was luck of a sort. At the same time, two new pupils
applied for lessons and he met Antoine Charbonnel, a
young man from La C&ocirc;te-Saint-Andr&eacute;, whose father had
often scandalized Mme. Berlioz because, being a tireless
woman chaser, he flew in the face of her family&rsquo;s ancient
motto, &ldquo;respectability above everything&rdquo;. Charbonnel, a
budding pharmacist, found it advisable to share economics
with Hector and the pair set up bachelor quarters
in two little rooms in the Rue de la Harpe. Charbonnel
cooked and Hector marketed, grossly violating the
hygienic codes of his friend by carrying the day&rsquo;s provisions
unwrapped under his arm.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Hector calls the &ldquo;Francs-Juges&rdquo; overture his &ldquo;first
grand instrumental work&rdquo;. It was soon followed by another
overture, &ldquo;Waverly&rdquo;. He was, he tells us, so
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
ignorant of the mechanism of certain instruments at that
period, that he had written the trombone solo in the
earlier score in the key of D flat, uncertain whether this
choice of tonality was a wise one or not. On submitting
the passage to a trombone player at the Op&eacute;ra he was
delighted to learn that it was the best possible key for
the purpose and that the solo in question could not fail
to produce a powerful effect. Greatly elated he walked
home as in a dream and was recalled to himself by suddenly
spraining his ankle. From that moment he could
never hear the piece without experiencing a sharp pain
in his foot. &ldquo;Perhaps&rdquo;, he muses in his Memoirs, &ldquo;it gives
others a pain in their heads&rdquo;! Curiously enough, neither
Reicha nor Lesueur, taught him anything about instrumentation.
Thanks to a friend at the Op&eacute;ra he obtained
free tickets and by close listening at such performances
and study of such scores as were given he &ldquo;perceived the
subtle connection ... between musical expression and
the special art of instrumentation, which no one had
actually pointed out to me. It was by studying the
methods of ... Beethoven, Weber and Spontini; by an
impartial examination of the regular forms of instrumentation,
and of unusual forms and combinations;
partly by listening to artists and getting them to make
experiments for me on their instruments, and partly by
instinct, that I acquired what knowledge I possess&rdquo; and
was later to disseminate in his great treatise on instrumentation,
subsequently modernized by Richard Strauss.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Hector was officially admitted to the Conservatoire
when, the next examination period having come around,
he succeeded at last in passing the test. He was less
fortunate with an orchestral <i>scena</i> on the death of
Orpheus which the students were required to compose,
though Berlioz ascribed his failure to the incompetence
of a mediocre pianist obliged to play the reduction of
the original score. He had obtained a brief leave from
his duties at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Nouveaut&eacute;s when he came
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
down with a dangerous attack of quinsy sore throat.
Alone one night and on the point of strangling he suddenly
sat down before his shaving mirror, seized a pen
knife and, in a paroxysm of agony, lanced the obstruction
which was suffocating him. By some miracle he was on
his feet again in a few days and had the satisfaction
of hearing from his suddenly repentant father that his
allowance was to be restored. Having no further need
of continuing his chorister chores he was now free to
devote his evenings to opera performances.</p>
<p>These evenings, he declares, were &ldquo;solemn&rdquo; occasions.
They could be tumultous ones, as well; for Hector was
violent when matters outraged him and as often as not
became an irrepressible clacqueur. More than once he
helped precipitate riots in the theatre. When at a performance
of &ldquo;Iphig&eacute;nie en Tauride,&rdquo; for instance, cymbals
were introduced into a ballet passage where Gluck
has only strings and when trombones were omitted from
a passage in Orestes&rsquo; third act recitative Hector would
suddenly shout with all his might: &ldquo;There are no cymbals
there; who has dared to correct Gluck?&rdquo; Then, in
an Orestes passage: &ldquo;Not a sign of a trombone; it is
intolerable!&rdquo; Again, during a performance of Dalayrac&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Nina&rdquo; Berlioz missed a violin solo scheduled to be
played by the violinist, Baillot. Just as the cue for the
expected solo was reached a furious voice was heard to
exclaim: &ldquo;So far good, but where is the violin solo?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Very true&rdquo;, cried someone else, &ldquo;it looks as if they were
going to leave it out. Baillot, Baillot, the violin solo.&rdquo;
The pit took fire, the entire house rose and loudly demanded
that the program should be carried out according
to schedule. Before long people dashed into the
orchestra, overturning chairs and music desks, smashing
the kettledrums. Meanwhile, Hector who had sown
the wind tried to control the whirlwind with sarcastic
protests: &ldquo;Gentlemen, don&rsquo;t smash the instruments!
What vandalism! Don&rsquo;t you see you are destroying
Father Chenie&rsquo;s beautiful double-bass, with its infernal
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
tone?&rdquo; But the mob was beyond control and broke
not only instruments but innumerable seats and music
stands as well!</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>It was 1827 and he was beginning to harbor more far-darting
ambitions. In June he planned to try for the
Prix de Rome, though he really laid small value on
the &ldquo;honor&rdquo; the winning of it conferred. How often was
it no more than a means to an end!</p>
<p>Three times Berlioz competed (four if we count the
preliminary test of 1826, in which he failed), but not till
1830 did he carry off the honor. In 1827 he had written
for the purpose &ldquo;La Mort d&rsquo;Orph&eacute;e&rdquo;, in 1828 he gained
the second prize, in 1829 (when no prize was finally
given) he turned out a &ldquo;Cl&eacute;op&acirc;tre&rdquo;&mdash;which, had it been
less audacious, might have won him the award&mdash;while
in 1830 his cantata, &ldquo;Sardanapale&rdquo;, finally achieved the
ultimate distinction. But this honor, so highly regarded
among the rank and file of Frenchmen, was for Hector
soon to turn to something like Dead Sea fruit.</p>
<p>On Sept. 11, 1827, Kemble&rsquo;s company from London
inaugurated a Shakespearian season at the Od&eacute;on Theatre.
&ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; was the first offering, with the famous
English actor in the title role. The Ophelia was Henrietta
Smithson, tall, lithe and Irish. All literary and
artistic Paris was on hand. From the moment the daughter
of Polonius stepped on the stage Hector was lost!
No thunderbolt could more completely have devastated
him. When the performance ended he rushed home,
avoiding all acquaintances to whom he might have had
to talk. Then he went out again and walked all night
along the Seine, determined to wear himself out to obtain
the temporary solace of sleep. It was useless. Next
evening the visitors were giving &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo;.
Hector dashed to the Od&eacute;on early in the day and bought
himself a ticket, to be sure no unforeseen hitch might
prevent him obtaining his usual admission. As he knew
no word of English, he procured a translation and strove
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
for a few hours to recreate in his mind a picture of
Henrietta Smithson before again looking upon her in the
flesh. If possible the effect of the previous evening was
intensified.</p>
<p>He would now wander aimlessly through suburbs and
countryside, sometimes even sleeping in open fields; or
he would set to music Irish lyrics by Thomas Moore;
or steep himself in more Shakespeare, dabble in Byron
and Walter Scott, set about discovering Goethe and
acquainting himself with &ldquo;Faust!&rdquo; He moved from the
quarters of his friend Charbonnel and installed himself
in a room in the Rue Richelieu directly opposite the
house where Henrietta lived. He had never so much
as exchanged a word with the actress who, for
her part, never yet dreamed that such a person as
Hector Berlioz existed&mdash;let alone that he loved her
wildly. Nonetheless, Hector made a point of avoiding
further Shakespeare performances&mdash;or so at least, he
claims in his Memoirs. &ldquo;More experiences of the kind
would have killed me!&rdquo; But the inspiration of this Juliet
and Ophelia, further enhanced by the romantic literature
with which he was suffusing himself and the grandeur
of those Beethoven works he was beginning to discover,
were stimulating his creative fancy. He wrote overtures
based on &ldquo;Waverly&rdquo;, &ldquo;King Lear&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Corsair&rdquo;; he
wrote (in 1829) &ldquo;Eight Scenes from Faust&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;Ballade of the King of Thule, in Gothic Style&rdquo; (things
which were later to form the basis of &ldquo;La Damnation
de Faust&rdquo;); he composed a set of &ldquo;Nine Irish Songs&rdquo;;
above all, he wrote (and then revised) a work which was
to become, in some respects, his most widely known and
famous, the &ldquo;Symphonie Fantastique&rdquo;&mdash;a kind of
symphonic phantasmagoria, with Henrietta as its chief
motivation and himself as its chief actor.</p>
<p>It was not till December, 1827, that the actress first
had a fleeting glimpse of her worshipper. This happened
quite by chance at a rehearsal for a benefit performance
at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique where Hector was to offer an
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
overture of his and where some of the English actors were
to perform a couple of Shakespearian scenes. By this time
he had begun to write her letters, to which she never
replied, for they frightened her and she presently ordered
her maid not to accept any more from the postman.
When Berlioz at a rehearsal caught sight of Henrietta
talking to her colleagues backstage he uttered a loud
cry and rushed from the theatre, wildly wringing his
hands. Thinking she had to do with a madman the
actress begged her associates to watch him closely, for
&ldquo;she did not like the look of his eyes&rdquo;. The mop of red
hair that surmounted his head like an umbrella, his gaunt
visage, fiery appearance and generally hysterical demeanor
must have given her reason for alarm and she
probably breathed more freely when she left Paris for
Holland.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Everyone who has interested himself even slightly in
Berlioz is doubtless familiar with the lurid fiction the
composer invented to form the &ldquo;plot&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Fantastic
Symphony&rdquo;. In this &ldquo;Episode in the Life of an
Artist&rdquo; a high-strung youth is represented as seeking release
from the torments of disappointed love by means
of an overdose of opium. Instead of killing him the
drug afflicts him with a succession of perturbing, not to
say terrifying, grotesque or macabre visions. Through
each of them there moves the image of the Beloved,
musically-represented by a recurrent string of notes&mdash;a
sort of representative theme, or &ldquo;id&eacute;e fixe&rdquo;. The youth
is a plaything of passions, reveries, jealousies, frenzies
at the outset; then he sees his idol, apparently indifferent
to him, the central figure at a brilliant ball; amorous
thoughts mingle in his mind with dark presentiments as
he wanders over the countryside, rendered more melancholy
by the pipings on rustic instruments of two love-sick
shepherds, till thunderclaps interrupt their mournful
dialogue. Then he dreams he has murdered his beloved
and is marched to the scaffold; after which his
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
disembodied spirit becomes the sport of a noisome rout
of demons, witches, succubi and other infernal things,
among whom the cherished one, now a devilish harridan,
pursues him, while the Dies Irae resounds blasphemously
in his ears.</p>
<p>Doubtless much of the astounding score incorporates
musical ideas originally conceived for other projected
works. One way or another, the &ldquo;Fantastique&rdquo; is a formidable,
if overdimensioned monument of its period, and
a landmark of history. With all its flamboyant and parodistic
monstrosities this fresco of psychopathic experience
remains the first great and influential specimen of program
music created in France; and it is no less amazing
to reflect that the epochal score came into being when
its composer was but 27 and only at the time he was
adjudged worthy of the Prix de Rome.</p>
<p>Berlioz subsequently sent tickets for a performance
of the symphony to Henrietta Smithson. She appears to
have been about the only person in the hall unaware at
that time that she was the heroine of the piece. More
or less vaguely she had been hearing of the infatuation
of her harassed admirer. Her reaction, lightly expressed,
had been &ldquo;There could be nothing more impossible!&rdquo;
It was not in Hector&rsquo;s nature to accept such a rejection
as final. Still, she had unwittingly wounded him! For a
while he decided that, with all her beauty and her gifts,
she was no different from the average run of females. If
she could think of repudiating his love the &ldquo;Fantastique&rdquo;
was <i>his</i> derisive answer! This musical caricature of the
actress, he intended as a gesture of vengeance.</p>
<p>The new symphony, however, helped gain him a
friend and defender, who was to remain one of his most
valiant supporters for life&mdash;Franz Liszt. Liszt had met
Hector shortly before and, transported by the symphony,
he made a piano arrangement of it, which propagandized
the work as, at the time, nothing else could have done.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Scarcely liberated (as he thought) from Henrietta,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
Berlioz succumbed to another woman. This young person,
decidedly no better than she should have been, was
a friend of Ferdinand Hiller and a piano pupil of Kalkbrenner
and Herz. Camille Moke set her nets for Hector
and captured him without the slightest trouble. She came
into his life at the worst possible moment! With the consent
of her mother, briefly blinded by the young
man&rsquo;s success in winning the Roman Prize, Camille became
engaged to her admirer, who was just about to
set out for that sojourn in Rome which was the chief
reward of a lucky contestant. He seems not to have foreseen
trouble, though his sister, Nanci, was beset by premonitions;
and Ferdinand Hiller sent to Berlioz, in
Rome, the ironic message that his betrothed &ldquo;was bearing
the separation with fortitude&rdquo;. Shocked but still only half
convinced, Hector took to bed and waited vainly for
Camille&rsquo;s expected letters to Italy. Time passed and
nothing came. Whatever interest he might have found in
the Eternal City, where he had been warmly received
by his fellow students at the Villa Medici and by its
director, Horace Vernet, he was unable to pay any
attention to his work or his agreeable surroundings.
Little really mattered&mdash;neither the monuments of
Rome, the French Academy, his meeting with the well-graced
youth, Felix Mendelssohn, his future prospects.
Vernet, noticing Hector&rsquo;s worry, began to entertain serious
misgivings. Summoning the newcomer he warned
him against any rash step. Finally, on Good Friday the
tormented lover impulsively left Rome, resolved to
return to Paris and find out for himself what lay behind
Camille&rsquo;s silence. In roundabout ways he got as far as
Nice. On the journey he bought a pistol and some poison
determined to learn the truth and if worst came to worst
to shoot Camille and then make an end of himself. He
was not obliged to go to these spectacular extremes.
For at long last he received a letter&mdash;not, indeed, from
his presumable fianc&eacute;e, but from her mother. That lady
informed Hector that her daughter was on the point of
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
marrying Mr. Pleyel, the famous piano manufacturer;
and she requested her &ldquo;son-in-law&rdquo; not to kill himself!</p>
<p>Of course he would kill himself&mdash;and the Mokes as
well! But as he looked at the lovely C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Azur landscape
unrolled before him from the heights of the
Grande Corniche he suddenly experienced a revulsion
of feeling. For the time being he would go on living! He
dispatched a letter to Horace Vernet saying he was returning
to Rome and pledging his honor to remain in
Italy. Then he settled down for three weeks in Nice and
wrote his &ldquo;King Lear&rdquo; Overture.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Hector became more or less resigned to Rome, now
that the Moke affair was definitely at an end; but was
never completely at home there. He enjoyed the company
of Mendelssohn, for the two were well matched,
intellectually, if not well balanced by temperament.
However, Felix adored Gluck as much as Hector and
the two youths delighted in singing and playing
&ldquo;Armide&rdquo; together. They agreed whole-heartedly in
their worship of Mozart, Beethoven and Weber but disagreed
on Bach, whom the German idolized but to whom
Berlioz remained cold. When the pair went over Hector&rsquo;s
prize-crowned &ldquo;Sardanapale&rdquo; and the Frenchman
frankly expressed his dislike for a certain number in it,
Mendelssohn told his friend he was happy to see that
he really displayed such good taste! Hector made the
usual excursions, saw the regulation sights, visited the
mountains of the Abruzzi, wandered about the Campagna,
renewed his Virgilian recollections, sang,
strummed his guitar, heard the operas and the generally
trivial and ill performed church music and mingled with
the painters at the Caf&eacute; Greco. In short, he went more
or less through the customary tourist routine.</p>
<p>Also, he composed. He made changes in the score of
the &ldquo;Fantastique&rdquo; adding, for one thing, a coda to the
Ball Scene; he wrote overtures to &ldquo;The Corsair&rdquo;, based
on Byron, and &ldquo;Rob Roy&rdquo; based on Scott, not to mention

an ambitious pendant to the &ldquo;Fantastique&rdquo;, &ldquo;Le
Retour &agrave; la Vie&rdquo;, to which he subsequently gave the
alternative title of &ldquo;L&eacute;lio&rdquo;. But by 1832 he decided he
had endured as much of Rome as he could stomach. After
a compromise with Horace Vernet he cut short his stay
at the Villa Medici by six months promising to spend a
year in Germany&mdash;an ambition he had always cherished.</p>
<p>In November, 1832, Berlioz was back in Paris, and in
that very house where Henrietta Smithson had lodged on
her first visit. In fact, she had moved out only a day
earlier and settled in an apartment on the Rue de Rivoli.
Small wonder that Hector discerned the working of destiny
once more!</p>
<p>This time Henrietta had come to Paris with her own
theatrical company. Incredible as it may seem, she and
Hector had not yet actually met. The Irish actress
divined his passion fully when, at a performance under
the conductor Habeneck (at which not only the &ldquo;Fantastique&rdquo;
but also the monodrama, &ldquo;L&eacute;lio&rdquo;, were performed)
she heard from the actor who spoke the text
the words: &ldquo;Ah, could I but find this Juliet, this Ophelia,
whom my heart is ever seeking.... Could I but sleep
my last sad sleep in her beloved arms&rdquo;! Instead of going
to Germany at New Year&rsquo;s, 1833, Berlioz determined
to remain, for the moment, in Paris. His love for Henrietta
had been newly awakened; and she was now willing
to be formally introduced to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that day I had not a moment&rsquo;s rest. Terrible
fears were succeeded by delirious hopes. What I went
through ... cannot be described. Her mother and sister
formally opposed our union. My own parents would not
hear of it. Discontent and anger on the part of both
families, and all the scenes to which such opposition
gives birth in these cases&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Portents of trouble followed thick and fast. Henrietta
Smithson&rsquo;s theatrical venture failed disastrously. Financially
she was utterly ruined, the more so as she had
contracted immense debts. Next, she fell and broke her
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
leg. She was bed-ridden and she remained an invalid.
Hector organized a benefit concert for her. Among the
first to offer their services were Liszt and Chopin. Enough
was realized to settle &ldquo;Harriet&rsquo;s&rdquo; most pressing obligations.
And then, despite his parents&rsquo; objections and the
venomous hostility of Henrietta&rsquo;s hunchbacked sister,
Hector married her in the autumn of 1833&mdash;first, how
ever, staging a spectacular suicide act to frighten her into
wedlock. She was, he assured his friend Humbert Ferrand,
&ldquo;aussi vierge qu&rsquo;il soit possible de l&rsquo;&ecirc;tre&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To keep the domestic pot boiling he found it advisable
about this period to take up musical journalism. Although
Berlioz had been contributing on and off to certain
publications his present connection with L&rsquo;Europe
litt&eacute;raire is, to all intents, the official beginning of that
critical activity of his which was to span almost the
remainder of his life. As subsequent music reviewer on
the influential Journal des D&eacute;bats he spent no end of
time and effort in commenting on compositions and performances,
good, bad and indifferent, which he might
infinitely better have dedicated to creative work. The
labor revolted him but he found himself as helpless as
a galley slave. Enforced attendance at innumerable
concerts and operas he came to loathe to such an extent
that, late in his career when he was finally able to shake
off the journalistic fetters, he enjoyed walking up and
down in front of a theatre or concert hall just for the
pleasure of reflecting that he did <i>not</i> have to go in!
And yet, of all celebrated composers, Berlioz was by all
odds the most brilliantly gifted litterateur, whose writings
even today preserve most of their individuality,
polished style, barbed irony and scintillant humor. Aside
from his countless feuilletons and other articles, his
Memoirs, Soir&eacute;es de l&rsquo;Orchestre, A Travers Chants and
much else are literary masterpieces of their kind, which
even today retain their freshness and sparkle. Undoubtedly
his important journalistic affiliations had the effect
of involving him in numberless intrigues and difficulties
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
inseparable from posts of influence, besides sapping his
energies that should have been employed otherwise. Yet
he knew how to draw profit from the means of publicity
and power which his connections placed in his hands and
he did not hesitate to promote, as best possible, his personal
interests.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>When their marriage was solemnized at the British
Embassy (with Liszt as best man) Hector had exactly
two hundred francs and Harriet&mdash;a mountain of debts!
For their honeymoon they could travel no further than
the suburb of Vincennes. The wedding trip, according
to the groom, was &ldquo;a masterpiece of love&rdquo;. All the same,
he soon had chances to notice that his bride was not in
the least musical; likewise, that she harbored a streak
of jealousy. Not even the birth of their son, Louis, on
August 15, 1834, at their home on the hill of Montmartre
helped smooth this unhappy state of affairs, which was
to deepen as time went on. Harriet grew violently opposed
to her husband&rsquo;s traveling, though Berlioz claims
that &ldquo;a mad and for some time an absolutely groundless
jealousy was at the bottom of it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Was it &ldquo;absolutely groundless&rdquo;? The composer&rsquo;s intimate
associate, Ernest Legouv&eacute;, has let us into many
secrets about the rift in the lute in his book &ldquo;Soixante
Ans de Souvenirs&rdquo;. The blond Irishwoman, some years
older than her husband, was gradually losing her looks,
her failures as an actress had for some time increasingly
embittered her and she presently took to drink. The
more the sentiments of the formerly so ardent Hector
&ldquo;changed to a correct and calm good fellowship&rdquo;, says
Legouv&eacute;, &ldquo;the more his wife became imperious in her
exigencies and indulged in violent recriminations that
were unfortunately justified. Berlioz, whose position as
critic and as composer producing his own works made
the theatre his real world, found there occasions for
lapses that would have proved too much for stronger
heads than his; moreover, his reputation as a misunderstood
great artist endowed him with a halo that easily
tempted his female interpreters to become his consolers.
Madame Berlioz searched his feuilletons for hints of his
infidelities. And not only there: fragments of intercepted
letters, drawers indiscreetly opened, brought her revelations
just sufficient to make her beside herself without
more than half-illuminating her. Her jealousy was always
outdistanced by the facts. Berlioz&rsquo;s heart went so
fast that she could not keep pace with it; when, after so
much research, she lighted upon some object of his
passion, <i>that</i> particular passion was no more; and then,
it being easy for him to prove his innocence at the moment,
the poor woman was as abashed as a dog which
after having followed a track for half an hour, arrives at
the lair only to find the quarry already gone&rdquo;. Yet the
jealous instincts of the once lovely Ophelia and Juliet
were, in fact, only too sound and, if her shrewishness
increased by leaps and bounds, she had no little cause
for it.</p>

<p>Hector&rsquo;s friends seemed, perhaps, a little less devoted
to him since his marriage, and since his miseries were a
trifle less spectacular than they had been during his
bachelor days. But these comrades included not a few
personages illustrious in their respective spheres. Among
them were the musical chroniclers Janin and d&rsquo;Ortigue;
the essayists and novelists Legouv&eacute;, Eug&egrave;ne Sue, Alexandre
Dumas, Sainte-Beuve, Victor Hugo; among the
creative and performing musicians, Liszt of course and
Chopin, who though personally the antithesis of Berlioz,
never wavered in his faithfulness to the man. And further,
flashing like a comet across the firmament of Hector,
there was the &ldquo;demon fiddler&rdquo;, Paganini.</p>
<p>In 1834 Berlioz composed the &ldquo;descriptive&rdquo; symphony
&ldquo;Harold in Italy&rdquo;, in which Byron&rsquo;s Childe Harold, the
central figure of the work was represented by a viola
solo. Whether Hector&rsquo;s account of the genesis of the
composition is wholly authentic or not, the tale he relates
in his Memoirs runs somewhat as follows: Having
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
heard the &ldquo;Symphonie Fantastique&rdquo; one day Paganini
came to see the composer and told him that he owned
a wonderful Stradivari viola which he would love to
play in public, though he had no music for it which
he considered suitable. Would Hector write him such
a work? He had no confidence in anyone else. The
only thing the violinist insisted upon was that &ldquo;he must
be playing the whole time&rdquo;. The work should not be an
ordinary concerto, but rather something along the lines
of the &ldquo;Fantastique&rdquo;. After many doubts and hesitations
the composer produced a series of scenes for orchestra,
the pictorial background of which was shaped out of
Hector&rsquo;s recollections of his Italian wanderings; while
the viola strain, representing Byron&rsquo;s dreamer, was added
to the rest of the orchestral texture &ldquo;with which it contrasts
both in movement and character, without hindering
the development&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Paganini did not hear the symphony till some time
after it had been first performed, for he had been south,
vainly seeking relief from that cancer of the larynx which
had robbed him of his voice and was shortly to prove
fatal. At the close of the work he ordered his son to tell
the composer &ldquo;he had never in his life been so impressed
at a concert&rdquo; and were he to follow his inclination, he
would &ldquo;go down on his knees to thank him&rdquo;. And then,
in full view of the audience, the great violinist did just
that and kissed Hector&rsquo;s hand! Next day he received a
letter in Paganini&rsquo;s writing which ran: &ldquo;Beethoven is
dead and Berlioz alone can revive him. I have heard
your divine compositions, so worthy of your genius, and
beg you to accept, in token of my homage, twenty
thousand francs....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost on the heels of this windfall Berlioz had the
additional luck of being commissioned by the government
to compose a Requiem, for an official ceremony.
The work is one of his most monumental&mdash;one might
say apocalyptic&mdash;even if the quality of its musical inspiration
may be open to question. One thing however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
is certain&mdash;nothing he ever wrote is so overwhelming
in point of sheer sonority as the appalling
Tuba Mirum, with its five orchestras, its sixteen kettle
drums and its phalanxes of trombones. At the climax
of this fresco of the Last Judgment one of the participating
singers succumbed in public to a shrieking frenzy
of nervous prostration!</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>There was talk in governmental circles of &ldquo;purchasing&rdquo;
the Requiem, of a grand decoration, of a professorship at
the Conservatoire, of a generous pension from the Beaux
Arts ministry. Nothing came of all these plans. As far
as the Conservatoire post was concerned Berlioz was
rejected as teacher of harmony at that institution on the
ground that he could not play piano&mdash;which was as true
as it was irrelevant. But a far greater and more fateful
disappointment lay ahead. Early in 1838 his mother&mdash;who
had cursed him&mdash;died at La C&ocirc;te-Saint-Andr&eacute;. Her
curse did not perish with her; in fact, it smote him soon
afterwards when his lyric drama, &ldquo;Benvenuto Cellini&rdquo;,
failed grievously at the Op&eacute;ra, where after long and torturing
efforts he at length managed to have it performed.
Not even today can it be said to have gained anything
like a permanent foothold on the stage.</p>
<p>As time went on Hector tried to master his inhospitable
fate in the operatic theatre by various compromises
and subterfuges. He sought to create a &ldquo;dramatic symphony&rdquo;,
based on &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo;, and neither outright
drama nor outright symphony&mdash;which accounts for
its infrequent performance, despite the extraordinary
beauty of some of its music. He wrote a &ldquo;concert opera&rdquo;
which is, in effect, a cantata masquerading as an opera
and vice-versa. &ldquo;La Damnation de Faust&rdquo;, one of the
three most essential capturings in music of Goethe&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Faust&rdquo; drama, was at its first hearing in 1846 possibly the
most distressful defeats he ever suffered at the hands of
his countrymen. Not until decades after his death did he
enjoy a kind of posthumous revenge when Raoul Gunsbourg,
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
in Monte Carlo, fashioned a stage production
which is now one of the mainstays of the Paris Op&eacute;ra. A
destiny in some respects even more deplorable was that
of his music drama, &ldquo;Les Troyens&rdquo;, which he was never to
hear in its completeness. The one theatre work of Berlioz
to enjoy something like an uncontested triumph at its
launching was his two-act opera comique, &ldquo;B&eacute;atrice et
B&eacute;n&eacute;dict&rdquo;, for which Shakespeare provided the original
incentive. As for &ldquo;Rom&eacute;o et Juliette&rdquo;, its high points are
found in two movements&mdash;the rapturous love scene,
which includes the most enamoring melodic ideas Berlioz
ever conceived, and the unparagoned Queen Mab
scherzo, embodying the composer&rsquo;s instrumental fancy
at its most subtle and ravishing&mdash;even if Parisian criticism
of the time could see no more in it than &ldquo;a little
noise like that of an ill-greased syringe&rdquo;!</p>
<p>That long scheduled visit to Germany continued to be
deferred. Meantime Berlioz had been appointed assistant
librarian at the Paris Conservatoire, a small distinction,
to be sure; but offering at any rate a few additional
francs. A more ponderable achievement was the composition
for band of a three movement &ldquo;Symphonie fun&egrave;bre
et triomphale&rdquo;, planned for performance in the open air
in memory of those fallen in the Revolution of 1830.
The &ldquo;Funeral and Triumphal Symphony&rdquo; was one of
the first compositions of Berlioz which Wagner heard
when he arrived in Paris in 1840. Wagner was struck by
the nobility of the work, ranked it among the loftiest
achievements of its composer and retained an undissembled
admiration for it all his days. Berlioz had reason
to believe that, after this official labor, he might be called
to step into the shoes of Cherubini at the Conservatoire
when that worthy went to his reward in 1842. But the
choice fell upon Georges Onslow and Hector, realizing
that if he was ever to obtain in Paris the distinction to
which he felt himself entitled, he would have to enhance
his French reputation by properly publicized successes
abroad. So he began by giving several concerts in Brussels,
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
the second of which was destined to be important&mdash;less
so for musical reasons than because of domestic entanglements
it initiated.</p>
<p>Knowing Harriet&rsquo;s jealousy Hector seems to have been
strangely incautious about keeping secret the identity of
his &ldquo;traveling companion&rdquo;. It did not take his alternately
maudlin and aciduous Irish wife many days to find out
from the papers that a certain Marie Recio was the snake
in the grass. The Recio was a second rate singer, whose
real name was Marie Genevieve Martin. Hector had met
her in 1841. We are told that she rekindled in his heart
those romantic emotions the now slatternly and alcoholic
Harriet could no longer feed. Marie&rsquo;s mother encouraged
the liaison because she realized the power Berlioz
had come to be in the journalistic field. He had been so
imprudent as to impose her on one operatic management
and the game had turned out badly. Before long poor
Hector found himself as luckless in his second love affair
as he had been in his first.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>The various tours which Hector undertook in Germany
brought him artistic honors and material successes of
which in France he never dreamed. Among average audiences
he discovered a seriousness and a degree of taste
such as were limited to a few circles at home. He
refashioned old musical friendships and cultivated
new ones. Mendelssohn met him in Leipzig and the pair
continued the old artistic discussions and arguments as
they had years before in Rome. Felix &ldquo;was charming,
fascinating, ceaselessly obliging and determined to be a
guarantee for his French colleague&rsquo;s success&rdquo;. The two
exchanged batons to symbolize their professional amity.
Felix praised some of Hector&rsquo;s songs but avoided saying
a word about his symphonies, overtures or the Requiem
(actually, he detested them!) Berlioz saw Robert and
Clara Schumann, the former appeared &ldquo;wholly electrified
by the Offertory of my Requiem&rdquo;. The Schumanns
were hospitality itself, even if Clara sometimes found
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
the Frenchman &ldquo;cold, indifferent, morose&rdquo; and &ldquo;not the
kind of artist I like&rdquo;. Robert, however, &ldquo;feels a sympathy
for him which I cannot explain&rdquo;. Mendelssohn privately
confessed that he felt like washing his hands after he had
been through a Berlioz score. In Dresden there was
Richard Wagner, whose &ldquo;Rienzi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Flying Dutchman&rdquo;
Hector listened to with interest and who turned himself
inside out to assist the extraordinary visitor in training
orchestra and chorus for his concert in that city. One
thing astonished Berlioz and grew to be something of a
fly in the German ointment: that worship of Bach with
which he was surrounded! &ldquo;People do not believe that
this divinity can ever be subjected to question&rdquo;, he sighed.
&ldquo;Heresy on the subject is forbidden; Bach is Bach, just
as God is God!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>On these travels, which went on intermittently for
years, Hector visited not only Germany but also Austria,
Bohemia, Hungary, Russia. He went to Russia in 1847
and later. There he was greeted like a conqueror and
more than any other nation that country proved,
materially, a gold mine to him. A pity that the harsh
climate of places like St. Petersburg was, in the end, to
try him so sorely! For whenever he went there he was
literally overwhelmed with honors, decorations, costly
gifts. In short, whenever neglect or disappointment became
unbearable he could turn to Russia for at least
temporary alleviation.</p>
<p>In Vienna (1845) he found much to delight him. To
be sure he was often painfully struck by many things,
such as the lamentable &ldquo;ignorance prevailing with respect
to the works of Gluck&rdquo;. He was in the habit of
asking musicians if they knew &ldquo;Alceste&rdquo; or &ldquo;Iphigenia&rdquo;
and invariably he received the answer: &ldquo;They are never
performed in Vienna; we do not know them&rdquo;. Whereupon
his mental reaction would be: &ldquo;But, you wretched
creatures, whether they are performed or not, you ought
to know them by heart!&rdquo; On the other hand, he heard
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
numbers of remarkable artists and admits he &ldquo;would
have to write a book to do justice to each and to catalogue
all the musical wealth of Vienna in detail&rdquo;. He received,
naturally, the usual silver baton &ldquo;inscribed with the titles
of his works&rdquo;. Also, a little present of a hundred ducats
from the Emperor after one of his concerts in the Redouten
Saal; and, from the same exalted source, the message,
conveyed by the Imperial master of ceremonies:
&ldquo;Tell Berlioz that I was greatly amused&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Meanwhile the composer had been working by fits and
starts on &ldquo;The Damnation of Faust&rdquo;. He wrote page
after page of it at the most unbelievable times of day
and night and in the unlikeliest places&mdash;on the Boulevard
Poissoni&egrave;re, on a stone of the Boulevard du Temple,
in the park at Enghien (when in a somnambulistic trance
he had boarded a suburban train and it had simply deposited
him there); at Lille, at Rouen, in Passau, in
Prague, in Silesia; while walking, while eating, while
traveling. When he left Vienna for Budapest he prepared
to perform at his first Hungarian concert the Rakoczy
March of which he had made what, in effect, has
long been the standardized and most overpowering
orchestration of all. This national melody invariably
drove Magyar listeners into frenzies of patriotic enthusiasm
(for that matter few audiences even now can hear
it unstirred). And on the program piloted by Berlioz it
led to such a wild demonstration that, as he directed it,
the composer&rsquo;s hair stood on end and he was seized for
a few moments with a kind of nightmare terror. He
thereupon introduced the march into the score of &ldquo;The
Damnation&rdquo; and placed the opening scene of the Faust
action in Hungary so as to motivate the presence in the
score of the volcanic page.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>It is hard to grasp today that the first performance of
the &ldquo;Damnation of Faust&rdquo; at the Paris Op&eacute;ra Comique
(December 6, 1846) was the most heart-breaking fiasco
of Berlioz&rsquo; life. It was not a question of violent opposition
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
(if only it had been!) but of abysmal, devastating
indifference. Only a scattering of friends occupied the
first rows of the Salle Favart, with further back a handful
of cynical faces. Otherwise an inhuman emptiness
sat enthroned in the gaping theatre (the comic journal,
Charivari, sniggered that if the Song of the Rat went
unnoticed it was because there was not so much as a cat
in the house!). From the outset Berlioz knew himself
ruined, materially and spiritually. It was less the few
remaining francs saved on his travels which mattered
than the irreparable hurt done the morale of the afflicted
man. &ldquo;Nothing in my artistic career wounded me more
deeply than this unexpected indifference&rdquo;, he was to
write in his Memoirs&mdash;lapsing, for once, into pitiful
understatement! Not till 1877 was &ldquo;The Damnation of
Faust&rdquo; revived in Paris, by which time the composer had
been dead eight years.</p>
<p>Although Berlioz recouped some of his financial losses
from the &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; misadventure when he went to Russia
the following year he was the plaything of destiny once
again when, late in 1847, he accepted an invitation from
Louis Antoine Jullien to go to London and conduct
opera at the Drury Lane Theatre, of which Jullien was
then the manager. This spectacular French adventurer
and charlatan, who speculated ruinously, went to jail
for debt and died in a lunatic asylum, failed shortly
after Berlioz suffered himself to be inveigled into what
he thought would be a six years&rsquo; engagement; and the
composer, after giving a few concerts of his own music,
found himself back in Paris by July, 1848. But England
saw him again in 1851-52, when the New Philharmonic
Society of London secured him as conductor, and in 1855
when he occupied the same post&mdash;not to mention a visit
two years earlier when he was lured across the Channel
to witness a Covent Garden representation of his first
opera, &ldquo;Benvenuto Cellini&rdquo;. This turned out almost as
distressingly as had, in Paris, &ldquo;The Damnation of
Faust&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>It is one of the real misfortunes of musical history
that Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner never became
to each other the kinsmen and spiritual brothers they
should have been. Some unhappy flaw in their respective
natures always thwarted a consummation which, one
feels, fate should have preordained. Or some barrier
sprang up between them precisely at the moment they
should best have complemented each other. They had,
in the larger sense, the same ideals, the same luminous
visions, the same majestic aims, the same reluctance to
palter and to compromise. They were both tortured by
nerves and exacerbated by futile suspicions and
jealousies. Yet each had the true measure of the other&rsquo;s
importance, whether admitted or not. Prejudices and
preconceptions, sometimes artificially fostered, if not fed
by envy or rankling disappointment had a way of cropping
up to blind them as soon as they gave promise of
seeing eye to eye. Wagner was the stronger of the two,
not only as to creative power but in toughness of fibre.
But if they were not equally matched, the differences
and asperities of the one fitted perfectly into the natural
flaws and crudities of the other, as Wagner himself once
took occasion to point out.</p>
<p>Berlioz appears to have recognized in Wagner, much
as he may have resented it, a force of the future which
sooner or later must challenge him. All the same, it is
wrong to imagine that Wagner underrated his French
rival, however he discerned the weaknesses of his work.
His appreciation of the artist Berlioz was broader and
more fundamental than the appreciation of Berlioz for
him, which was so often soured by jealousy and blinded
by bias. Wagner was incontestably sincere when he
wrote: &ldquo;We must honor Berlioz as the true renewer of
modern music&rdquo;. Too few people are familiar with that
extraordinary episode at Bayreuth, long after the Frenchman&rsquo;s
death when the ageing Wagner flew into a towering
rage on hearing the still youthful Felix Mottl criticise
some detail of a Berlioz work. &ldquo;When a master like
Berlioz writes something you are too shallow to grasp
your duty is to accept it without question or murmur!&rdquo;
he had screamed at his astonished disciple.</p>

<p class="caption">Taken in the last year of his life (1869)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Only once did the pair draw close enough to justify
the belief that they might have developed, under more
hospitable circumstances, a lasting friendship. This was
in 1855, when the two men, in the depths of discouragement,
met in London whither Wagner had come to conduct
the Old Philharmonic. The improved relations were
only temporary. The creator of &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo; appreciated
that the jealous Marie Recio stood in the way of any
lasting rapprochement. And he confided to Liszt that
&ldquo;a malicious wife can ruin a brilliant man ... and bring
out the worst aspects of his character; indeed, I have
sometimes to wonder if God would not have done better
to have left women out of the scheme of creation&rdquo;. In
1861, at the &ldquo;Tannh&auml;user&rdquo; fiasco at the Paris Op&eacute;ra,
Berlioz played a part that reflects eternal discredit on his
memory, even if the shabby treatment he so often endured
at the hands of his countrymen could account for
his spitefulness.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>The domestic situation of Berlioz had hopelessly deteriorated.
Harriet, lame, coarse, shrewish had lost
the last vestiges of her once admired beauty and talent.
She was in due course to suffer paralytic strokes and then
to become bedridden. Her son, Louis, having grown to
young manhood, became an &ldquo;aspirant-marinier&rdquo; at Le
Havre and decided to follow the sea, inheriting an early
but unfulfilled ambition of his father. A true sailor he
had a wife in every port and Hector, who was aware of
the wanderer&rsquo;s inclinations, sometimes longed to meet
those grandchildren of his he knew lived scattered
through the hemispheres. Now and then Louis would
return briefly to Paris and look in on his wretched mother
at her little house on the hill of Montmartre. Occasionally
he would seek out his father at his domicile near the
Place Pigalle&mdash;though only when Marie Recio was out!
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
The moment he heard her footsteps in the hall he would
flee. He could not pardon his father and he said so unmistakably.
So did others! To all reproaches the unhappy
composer had only one helpless answer: &ldquo;What would
you? I love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet if that far-off adoration of his Ophelia and Juliet
had, apparently, long since turned to ashes something
like retribution was to overtake him. For years he had
been paying her routine visits, understanding her solitude
even as she divined his misery. But early in March,
1854, he was called to her bedside and found her dying.
At that, he was not even granted the wretched solace of
receiving her last breath! Harriet expired a few moments
after he had left the house on some trivial errand. The
blow was far more terrible than Hector had thought
possible. In a flash he recognized that he really loved the
wife more than he did the mistress; and in prodigious
rebellion he cursed &ldquo;that stupid God, atrocious in his
infinite indifference&rdquo;. To his son he wrote: &ldquo;You will
never know what your mother and I suffered because of
each other and it was these sufferings which brought us
so close together. It was as impossible for me to live
with her as without her!&rdquo; He was to see her once again!
Ten years later they exhumed her and, in Hector&rsquo;s
presence, placed her ghastly remains in a new coffin and
reinterred them in the Montmartre Cemetery.</p>
<p>In October, 1854, Berlioz legalized the situation of
Marie Recio by marrying her.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>More wanderings lay ahead of him. He could have
gone to New York, had he so chosen, and conducted
concerts there. Rightly or wrongly he declined the offer.
But in 1855 he harvested rich honors at a Berlioz Festival
which his untiring champion, Liszt, staged in Weimar.
A work which greatly stirred the audience at the Weimar
Court Theatre was the newly composed &ldquo;L&rsquo;Enfance du
Christ&rdquo;. This exquisite &ldquo;legend&rdquo;, as simple, transparent
and unpretentious as most of his other works are huge in
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
scale and demanding, is a delicate little trilogy divided
into sections respectively called &ldquo;Herod&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo;, &ldquo;The
Flight to Egypt&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Arrival in Sais&rdquo;. It looked,
for a while, like a turn in Hector&rsquo;s fortunes. Almost
wherever the oratorio was performed it met with a favor
to which the composer was quite unaccustomed. In Paris
there actually were ovations and the press spoke of a
&ldquo;masterpiece&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Berlioz was aware that Wagner, slowly but surely,
was elaborating his gigantic &ldquo;Nibelungen&rdquo; project and
he, too, became gradually filled with a scheme for a
mythological opera. His old love for Virgil&rsquo;s gods and
heroes, dating back to the days of his boyhood and his
Latin readings in his father&rsquo;s library, reasserted itself.
He dreamed of a vast fresco in which the siege of Troy,
Aeneas, Hector, Priam, Cassandra, Dido and the rest of
the splendid personages of the Mediterranean world
should be combined in the action of a great lyric tragedy
carried out &ldquo;in the Shakespearian manner.&rdquo; But though
the idea fired him it also terrified him as he thought of
the giant efforts it involved and the disappointments it
was sure to entail. He confided his ambitions and his
fears to Liszt&rsquo;s friend, the Princess Caroline Sayn-Wittgenstein.
It was she who spurred him to the task
and overrode his doubts and scruples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must create this opera, this lyric poem or whatever
you choose to call it&rdquo;, the Princess insisted, and as
he continued to plead the troubles it meant, she silenced
him with a pretended severity: &ldquo;Listen! If you shun the
sufferings which this labor may and, indeed, ought to
cause you&mdash;if you are so weak as to be afraid of it, if
you refuse to dare everything for the sake of Dido and
Cassandra, then stay away from me, I never want to
see you again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a liberating word and Berlioz returned to Paris
for the heart-breaking business of writing poem and
music. He had foreseen its pains and obstacles only too
clearly, but he wrestled furiously with them and kept the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
oath he had given. Sombre and lonely he composed,
revised, expanded, cut down, suppressed and altered in
a thousand different ways. The epic seemed to be taking
all sorts of impractical forms and the composer realized
that even all the conventional devices of dramaturgy
might not avail to fit it for the theatre. Two years of
intensive work brought the end of the score in 1858.
Meanwhile Berlioz had terminated his Memoirs, which
he kept at the Conservatoire out of fear that his second
wife, in the course of her often indiscreet searchings,
might light upon some secrets he preferred to hide. In
the end he confided the manuscript to Liszt, to thwart
Marie&rsquo;s curiosity if he were to die. For Hector had been
much haunted by thoughts of death as the time went by.
Years of disappointment were more and more taking
toll of his nervous system. He was tortured by what the
doctors called &ldquo;intestinal neuralgia&rdquo;, against which medicine
appeared to be unavailing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Les Troyens&rdquo; was, in many ways, the supreme
blow of his life and more than anything else his child
of sorrow. In the year of its completion he tried in vain
to have it sung at the Op&eacute;ra. Three years later that institution
accepted it but did not give it. Finally, L&eacute;on
Carvalho, manager of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Lyrique, mounted it
on November 4, 1863. The composer had found it necessary
to divide his six and a half hour opera into two
parts&mdash;&ldquo;La Prise de Troie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Les Troyens &agrave;
Carthage&rdquo;&mdash;to make a performance possible at all. At
that there were cuts, changes, revisions without end, and
to this day versions and &ldquo;editions&rdquo; have been found indispensable
if the work is to be made a practical stage
piece. The first presentation did not include the &ldquo;Prise
de Troie&rdquo; half, and this portion of the work, of which
Cassandra, the composer&rsquo;s beloved &ldquo;heroic virgin&rdquo; is the
central figure, Berlioz was never to witness. In spite of
innumerable difficulties and the unfinished state of the
representation the piece was moderately successful at
first, the reviews in the main favorable, the box office fair
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
and Hector himself delighted with as much of his creation
as he heard. But the worries and tribulations the
opera involved (for any change he wanted Hector had to
pay out of his own pocket) brought a nervous breakdown
and he managed to attend no more than four performances.
As soon as his back was turned the management
cut and slashed the score without compunction. By the
end of a month audiences had fallen off to such an extent
that, before Christmas, &ldquo;Les Troyens&rdquo; disappeared from
the repertoire. This new blow promised to break the unhappy
composer&rsquo;s spirit altogether. &ldquo;My career is
finished&rdquo; he told someone who hoped for an early resumption
of the work. &ldquo;I have neither hopes, illusions
nor great ideas left&rdquo;, he reflected bitterly; &ldquo;my contempt
for the stupidity and dishonesty of people has reached its
peak....&rdquo; And when he was told that audiences were
beginning to flock to hear some work of his he would
reply: &ldquo;Yes, they are coming; but I am going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On June 14, 1862, Marie Recio died suddenly of a
heart attack. The blow struck Hector much less violently
than did the passing of his first wife. Possibly the circumstance
that he was engaged on a new work at the
time somewhat blunted the edge of his grief. This latest
creation&mdash;his last, as it proved&mdash;was the two act opera
comique, &ldquo;B&eacute;atrice et B&eacute;n&eacute;dict&rdquo;, a lyric version of &ldquo;Much
Ado About Nothing&rdquo;&mdash;given for the first time at the
newly built casino in Baden-Baden. &ldquo;B&eacute;atrice et B&eacute;n&eacute;dict&rdquo;
proved to be a repetition of the &ldquo;Enfance du
Christ&rdquo; surprise&mdash;a brilliant success from the first.
Berlioz was happy, but also cynical. &ldquo;People are now
discovering that I have melody, that I can be jubilant
and even humorous!&rdquo; he wrote. Another triumph of
the new work at Weimar, in 1863, further demonstrated
that the piece had been born under a lucky star. Like
Verdi, thirty years later, Berlioz was disposed to conclude
his creative career with a comedy inspired by his
idolized Shakespeare. &ldquo;I have written the final note with
which I shall ever soil a scrap of music paper. No more
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
of that! Othello&rsquo;s occupation&rsquo;s gone; I should like to
have nothing more to do&mdash;nothing, absolutely nothing!&rdquo;
Actually, he had much more to do&mdash;conducting, writing,
traveling, suffering. Yet so far as making music was
concerned he was finished.</p>
<p>After Marie Recio&rsquo;s death Hector lived with his
mother-in-law, whom he esteemed and who, in turn,
loved him. Love of a different kind still lured him on.
He met a young girl, by name Am&eacute;lie and felt a fresh
upsurge of romantic passion. But in six months she, too,
was dead. Meanwhile Berlioz and his son had drawn
much closer together, spiritually. Yet Louis was generally
far from France and the pair, though they corresponded,
saw but little of each other. One evening a number of
Hector&rsquo;s closest musical friends, angered by the persistent
neglect of the composer by his own countrymen,
staged a little private glorification in his honor. They
waited for the guest of the occasion and when time
passed and he did not come a messenger was sent to
fetch him. Berlioz lay on the floor of his room, writhing
in an agony of grief. He had just received word that
Louis was dead in Havana!</p>
<p>He was inspired by a sudden wish to renew one of the
ties of his boyhood. And the thoughts of the eternal
adolescent turned to Estelle Duboeuf, his &ldquo;Stella Montis&rdquo;
of long ago. She was now a widowed old lady, patrician
and proper, who had had a number of children, all of
whom she had carefully reared and some of whom she
had lost. She lived in Lyon and to that city Hector
presently turned his steps. Estelle Fornier, amazed by
the unexpected visit and the importunities of her ageing
and weather-beaten guest, received him in kindly fashion,
alluded tactfully to his agitated life but, with gentle
firmness, discouraged his pleas for a somewhat closer
friendship. Nevertheless, Berlioz was carried away by
the mere joy of the meeting; and he chose to place an
extravagant interpretation on a few commonplace
phrases of hers and the words &ldquo;affectionate sentiments&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
with which she had concluded a brief message. He continued
from afar to worship this mirage and to build it
up into elaborate fictions. He corresponded further with
the decorous old lady, imagined vain things and confided
to the Princess Wittgenstein &ldquo;this kind of suffering is
indispensable to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he was off again on travels. In 1866 he
conducted &ldquo;La Damnation de Faust&rdquo; in Vienna and in
1867 led half a dozen concerts in St. Petersburg where
he made the acquaintance of Balakireff, Tchaikovsky
and other Russian musicians, till, unable to endure
the rigors of that climate, he returned to France,
longing passionately for the sunshine and warmth of the
Riviera. Walking on the beach at Monaco he suffered a
bad fall the consequence, it appears, of a slight stroke,
which recurred a few days later. He rallied, however,
though once back in Paris he found it necessary to spend
long and dreary days in bed. He had made his will,
leaving his books and scores to the Conservatoire and distributing
his meager &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; to his nieces, besides
settling a sum of 1800 francs on Estelle Fornier (which
she is said to have declined) and providing a tiny income
for his mother-in-law. Of his various crowns, laurel
wreaths and other &ldquo;trophies&rdquo; he made superb bonfire!
&ldquo;I feel that I am going to die&rdquo; he wrote his Russian
friend, Vladimir Stassoff. &ldquo;I believe in nothing any more
... I am exorbitantly bored. Farewell! Writing causes
me no end of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gradually his faculties refused to function; little by
little his brain became clouded, his tongue thickened, he
made no attempt to talk and appeared to want nothing.
On March 8, 1869, the long-embattled and sore-tried
fighter, who had never attained inner or outer harmony,
found peace. A final touch of irony was provided by the
fact that his graveside valedictory was spoken, in the
name of the Conservatoire, by a certain Elwart, to whom
Berlioz had once said: &ldquo;If <i>you</i> are to make a speech at
my funeral I prefer not to die!&rdquo;</p>
